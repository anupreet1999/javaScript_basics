/* There are two types of memory in js like 
    1   Stack (Used for primitive data types)
    2.  Heap (Used for Non - primitive data types)
 */

/* 

Stack: It is a data structure used to store static data. Static data refers to data whose size is known by the engine during compile time. In JavaScript, static data includes primitive values like strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined. References that point to objects and functions are also included. A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. This process is known as static memory allocation.


Heap: It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory. Instead, it allocates more space as required.

    // The newEmployee object will be stored in the stack and 
    // it will refer to the employee object in heap
